### bug

- [`9799f0db`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/commit/9799f0dbabea0b572a9b9111954fbf9aca63da71) ([#2802](https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/pull/2802) by [@lucasfernog](https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/../../lucasfernog)) Fixes iOS simulator still freezing sometimes due to early logging.

Like `KeepAll` it will rename files when the max file size is exceeded but will keep only the specified amount of files around.

## \[2.4.0]

- [`c9b21f6f`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/commit/c9b21f6f4345806eff5f495885f20dea0082b7d7) ([#2625](https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/pull/2625) by [@lucasfernog](https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/../../lucasfernog)) Export the `LogLevel` type.

- [`686a839c`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/commit/686a839c96fae1b0334f2df9dc76ca5cdbe00dbe) ([#2626](https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/pull/2626) by [@lucasfernog](https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/../../lucasfernog)) Fix iOS app stuck when using the iOS Simulator and the log plugin due to a deadlock when calling os_log too early.

### feat

- [`60fc35d3`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/commit/60fc35d35cccaf1654eceb4446ecf0f89dc15502) ([#2576](https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/pull/2576) by [@3lpsy](https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/../../3lpsy)) Add a `tracing` feature to the `log` plugin that emits log messages to the `tracing` system.

## \[2.3.1]

- [`1bb1ced5`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/commit/1bb1ced53820127204aa7adf57510c1cbce55e12) ([#2524](https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/pull/2524) by [@elwerene](https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/../../elwerene)) enable TargetKind::LogDir on mobile

## \[2.3.0]

### feat

- [`02481501`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/commit/024815018fbc63a37afc716796a454925aa7d25e) ([#2377](https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/pull/2377) by [@3lpsy](https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/../../3lpsy)) Add a `is_skip_logger` flag to the Log Plugin `Builder` struct, a `skip_logger()` method to the Builder, and logic to avoid acquiring (creating) a logger and attaching it to the global logger. Since acquire_logger is pub, a `LoggerNotInitialized` is added and returned if it's called when the `is_skip_looger` flag is set. Overall, this feature permits a user to avoid calling `attach_logger` which can only be called once in a program's lifetime and allows the user to control the logger returned from `logger()`. Additionally, it also will allow users to generate multiple Tauri Mock apps in test suites that run and parallel and have the `log` plugin attached (assuming they use `skip_logger()`).

## \[2.2.3]
